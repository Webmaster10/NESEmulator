Implied:
Cycle 1: fetch opcode
Cycle 2: fetch operand, execute instruction (for 2 cycle instructions this will finish, else usually does nothing)
Cycle 3+: execute instruction until finished (all implied instructions need cycle switch and instructionFinished=true at the end)

"fix the high byte of effective address"
When adding something to the low address byte, this may affect the high byte due to overflow
To resolve, in the "fix byte" cycle, add the overflow to the high byte
(This isn't fixed on zero page indexed instructions as the high byte is always 0)

Memory mirroring - Have array of pointers to memory locations
This array is used when reading or writing
Array points to base memory address if not mirroring location or
to original memory address if in mirroring zone
